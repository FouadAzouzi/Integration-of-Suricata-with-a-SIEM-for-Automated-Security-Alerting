# Final Project ‚Äì Higher Vocational Training: Integration of Suricata with a SIEM for Automated Security Alerting

## Summary
The goal of this project is to implement a **low-cost tool for detecting events** generated in the traffic of a local network. To achieve this, an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** such as **Suricata** is used.  
An IDS continuously monitors network and host activity to identify potential cyberattacks. When a suspicious or malicious event is detected, the IDS is configured to send **instant messaging alerts**, providing real-time monitoring and control.  

In addition to alerts, the IDS generates **reports and logs** that are integrated into a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** platform. The SIEM enables centralized analysis, reporting, and a fast, accurate response to security incidents, thus enhancing the protection of IT systems.

This repository contains the final report of my **Higher Vocational Training (Grado Superior)**.  
The project explores how to integrate **Suricata**, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), with a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** platform to collect, analyze, and generate automated **security alerts** in real time.
